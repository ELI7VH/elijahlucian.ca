# Creative Journal Web (CJW) Project Summary

## Overview

The Creative Journal Web project is a comprehensive multi-platform application ecosystem that serves as a reference implementation for building showcase applications, creative tools, and interactive experiences. It's designed to be a "showcase builder page thingy" that can be re-branded and deployed across various domains and platforms.

## Project Structure

### Core Components

#### Frontend (`/frontend`)

- **Technology Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Chakra UI
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-app build system with different deployment targets
  - Google Maps integration with marker clustering
  - Real-time audio recording and processing
  - QR code generation and scanning
  - Socket.io client for real-time communication
  - Framer Motion animations
- **Build Targets**:
  - Main elijahlucian.ca site
  - OCN Powwow app
  - OCN Voting app
- **Dependencies**: Uses @dank-inc ecosystem (banger, numbaz, super-mouse)

#### Backend (`/backend`)

- **Technology Stack**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + MongoDB
- **Key Features**:
  - RESTful API with session management
  - File upload handling with Multer
  - AWS S3 integration for file storage
  - OpenAI integration for AI features
  - FFmpeg for media processing
  - Socket.io server for real-time features
  - QR code generation
  - Web scraping capabilities
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

#### VR Experience (`/vr`)

- **Technology Stack**: Three.js + A-Frame + TypeScript
- **Key Features**:
  - 3D environment rendering
  - Audio synthesis with Tone.js
  - Procedural noise generation
  - Real-time 3D interactions
  - Socket.io integration for multiplayer

#### Mobile App (`/mobile-app`)

- **Technology Stack**: Apache Cordova
- **Status**: Basic template setup, appears to be in early development

### Infrastructure

- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-service compose setup
- **Development**: Hot reloading with nodemon and Vite
- **Build System**: ESBuild for backend, Vite for frontend
- **Deployment**: Multi-target deployment scripts for different domains

## Context with Current Web Project

### Similarities

- **Technology Overlap**: Both use React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Component Architecture**: Similar component-based structure
- **State Management**: Both use React hooks and context
- **Styling**: Component-based styling approach

### Key Differences

- **Scale**: CJW is a multi-app ecosystem vs. single web app
- **Architecture**: CJW has dedicated backend vs. current project's server
- **Features**: CJW includes VR, mobile, and advanced media processing
- **Deployment**: CJW supports multiple deployment targets and domains

### Potential Integration Points

1. **Component Library**: CJW's components could be adapted for current project
2. **Media Processing**: FFmpeg integration for audio/video features
3. **Real-time Features**: Socket.io implementation for live updates
4. **Multi-app Architecture**: Lessons for scaling current project
5. **VR Integration**: Potential for adding immersive experiences

## Development Status

- **Frontend**: Production-ready with multiple deployment targets
- **Backend**: Full-featured API with media processing
- **VR**: Functional 3D environment with audio
- **Mobile**: Template stage, needs development
- **DevOps**: Docker setup with production configurations

## Use Cases for Current Project

1. **Reference Implementation**: Study patterns for scaling and architecture
2. **Component Extraction**: Adapt useful components and hooks
3. **Feature Inspiration**: Ideas for advanced media and real-time features
4. **Deployment Patterns**: Multi-target build and deployment strategies
5. **Technology Integration**: Examples of FFmpeg, Socket.io, and 3D graphics

## Notes

- Project includes Trello board for feature tracking
- DigitalOcean cloud deployment configuration available
- Focus on creative tools and showcase applications
- Modular architecture allows for selective feature adoption
